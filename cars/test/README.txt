In game (2026-10-09): 17 and 21 load (21 up to 3,631 verts per file); 18 (25k) and 19 (8k) crash.
The dark triangle patches in 17/21: the game reads the paint mask per vertex (the original cars' masks are
flat color blocks), so a baked, detailed mask turns into triangle patches.

22_flat_colors_3500.zip  every triangle samples one flat mask cell for its material (paint red, rest
                         black), like the original cars; at most 3,500 verts per file (--colors palette)
